# throwaway-code-buildkit

Hey, it'd be a pleasure if you want to inspect/fork the repository. However
please keep in mind I've created this repository to document my
findings/learnings about buildkit and other things I wanted to explore at the
moment. So, expect typos, shortcuts and hacks ;)

You've warned!

## Topics to explore

- [ ] explore/experiment w/ builkt `llb`
- [ ] create a custom buildkit frontend
- [ ] _try_ to create a custom buildkit frontend in other language than Go
- [ ] _try_ to "compile" either frontend to wasm
- [ ] (if the last one worked) _try_ publishing an OCI image from wasm artifact
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit!
