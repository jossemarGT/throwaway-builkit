# Throwaway code

I have come to the realization that most of the time when I need to learn
something new, it becomes difficult in a hurry because I want to "get it right"
the first time and that is directly tied to the fact that I'm not giving me a
"sandbox" to experiment with the "thing" I want to learn about. With that in
mind, I created this repository to experiment to any given nobelty that comes
into to my path.

That said, it'd be a pleasure if you want to inspect/fork this repository.
However please keep in mind I've created it to document my findings/learnings
about "the thing" I wanted to explore at the moment. So, expect typos, shortcuts
and hacks ;)

You've warned!
