# Notes

## First round

- Read Mockerfile post and jump through the code
    - <https://matt-rickard.com/building-a-new-dockerfile-frontend>
    - <https://github.com/r2d4/mockerfile>

- Found Gockerfile, which offers a reduced DSL to interact with it
    - <https://github.com/po3rin/gockerfile>

- What is the Dockerfile frontend entrypoint?
    - Perhaps from the client reference? <https://github.com/tonistiigi/buildkit-pack/blob/master/manifest.go#L52>

- Buildkit's README introduces on `llb` <https://github.com/moby/buildkit#exploring-llb>
- It seems it is best to go w/buildkit examples. The first frontends I found were quite dated.

- Next Goal: Compile and run buildkit's examples
